## Module Exports/CatDogFight

### General information:

Two modules were created: Cat.js, which contains Cat class, and Dog.js, which contains Dog class.These modules were assigned to their module.exports. Dog and Cat classes are being exported, but we still need to require them into app.js for our function to work properly. At the top of the app.js file,  a variable Dog was created and was assigned as its value invoking the require() function with the relative path of the dog.js file. Next, a Cat variable was created and was assigned as its value invoking the require() function with the relative path of the cat.js file. Finally, _node_ command was executed in Fight.js file.
